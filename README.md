# Using Historical Reports of UFO Sightings from NUFORC Dataset to Predict Future Sighting Trends
Testing the effectiveness of different time series models at predicting future UFO sighting reports

## Introduction
The NUFORC Databank is the largest independently collected set of unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting reports available on the internet. This analysis aims to uncover trends in UFO sightings by addressing three key questions:

1. **Where are UFO sightings most frequent?** Are they concentrated in specific countries or states?
2. **When are UFO sightings most likely to occur?** Are they influenced by seasonal patterns?
3. **What are the most commonly reported UFO descriptions?** What shapes stand out in accounts?

By investigating these questions, we aim to identify trends in UFO sighting reports. Furthermore, we aim to use predictive models like time series to forecast future sightings. This approach will not only highlight historical patterns but will also help us anticapate future occurrences of UFO sightings.
